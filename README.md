# HTML and CSS - Module 1

## Lesson Task 2 Question

In this lesson assignment we're going to be taking off from the end of lesson task 1.1 where we created the HTML for the index.html page.

### Brief

In this lesson task you are going to create the other HTML files for the project, link them together, as well as linking to the images in the HTML.

By the end of this lesson task, you should have created the Guitars, Contact and Guitar specific page and linked them together. Don't add the contact form just yet, we'll do a video on that specifically.

When you have finished building the pages, switch across to the 'answers' branch to see how you could have completed the lesson task.

### Video

This video shows you how to complete the lesson task 1.2. Only watch it after attempting the lesson task by yourself.
